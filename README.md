 This project aims to develop an expert system for diagnosing plant diseases based on observed symptoms. The chosen symptoms include YellowOrangeBrownPustules and Defoliation, among others. Rules are formulated in IF-THEN format to recommend diseases based on the presence or absence of specific symptoms. A database of facts is established to store symptom data for matching against rules
