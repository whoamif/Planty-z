# AiProject

 This project aims to develop an expert system for diagnosing plant diseases based on observed symptoms. The chosen symptoms include YellowOrangeBrownPustules and Defoliation, among others. Rules are formulated in IF-THEN format to recommend diseases based on the presence or absence of specific symptoms. A database of facts is established to store symptom data for matching against rules
